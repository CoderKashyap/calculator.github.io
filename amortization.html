            <h3>About Mortgage Amortization Calculator</h3>

            <p>This loan calculator can help you find the payment amount and other information about your loan. You only
                need to adjust 6 inputs to get results with this loan calculator. The following inputs are required for
                the calculator to produce accurate results:</p>

            <p> <strong>Mortgage:</strong> This is the loan principal. It is the amount of money that you borrow plus
                any fees that may be added to the loan.</p>

            <p><strong>Property value:</strong> This is the total cost of the property you are purchasing. It includes
                the
                purchase price of the home itself and may include any additional costs such as closing fees or taxes.
                The loan amount is calculated based on the property value minus the down payment you can afford.</p>

            <p><strong>Down Payment:</strong> The down payment is the initial amount of money you pay upfront when
                purchasing a home. It is typically a percentage of the property value, and the larger the down payment,
                the
                less you'll need to borrow. A larger down payment can also help reduce your monthly mortgage payments
                and the overall cost of the loan by lowering the interest paid over time.</p>

            <p> <strong>Interest Rate:</strong> This is a fixed interest rate of your loan. This calculator assumes a
                fixed interest rate because it is impossible to accurately predict and calculate future variable
                interest rate.</p>

            <p> <strong>Amortization period:</strong> This is how long it will take for your loan to mature. At the end
                of the
                term, you will have your loan paid off in full. The longer your loan term, the less your monthly payment
                is, but the larger your loan total cost will be.</p>

        </div>

            <div class="sectionBorder"></div>

            <h3>Loan Payment Formula</h3>

            <p>To calculate your loan payments, you can use a simple loan payment formula that takes into account the
                loan's principal (the amount you borrowed), the loan’s term length, and the interest rate.</p>


            <div class="flex-box-center loanFormulaBox">

                <div class="flex-box-center LoanFormulaSubBox">
                    <span><strong>Loan Payment = </strong></span>
                    <div class="flex-box-center exactFormulaBox">
                        <span class="uponLineMakeByBorder">
                            <strong>(Loan Amount) (r) (1+r)<sup>n</sup></strong>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            <strong>(1+r)<sup>n</sup> - 1</strong>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <span>where</span>

                <div class="flex-box-center defineRN">
                    <span><strong>r</strong> = Periodic Interest Rate</span>
                    <span><strong>n</strong> = Number of Payments</span>
                </div>

            </div>



            <p> To find the periodic interest rate, you will need to know your payment frequency. This is how often
                you’ll be making loan payments. For example, if you will be making monthly loan payments, then your
                payment frequency is 12 (the number of months in a year). To find the periodic interest rate, divide the
                annual interest rate by the number of payments you’ll make in one year. You’ll then convert the rate
                into decimal form.</p>

            <h3>How To Calculate Loan Interest</h3>

            <p>To calculate the total interest paid on a loan, you will need to know your loan payment amount. Once you
                know how much your loan payment amount would be, to calculate the total interest paid on this loan, you
                would use the following formula.</p>

            <p><strong>Total Interest Paid = (Loan Payment x Number of Payments) – Loan Amount</strong></p>

            <p>For example, let’s say that you borrowed $10,000 for 5 years at a 5% interest rate. From our earlier
                example, we found the monthly payment amount would be $188.71, spread out over 60 monthly payments. How
                much interest would you pay over the life of this loan?</p>

            <p> Borrowing $10,000 at a 5% rate would cost you $1,322.60 due to interest charges over 5 years. </p>


            <div class="loanInterestFocusText">
                <p><strong>Total Interest Paid = ($188.71×60)−$10,000</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Total Interest Paid=$1,322.60</strong></p>
            </div>


            <p>This calculation uses the total lifetime payment of your loan, which is also another result that you can
                get from this page’s loan calculator. The total lifetime payment can be found by this formula:</p>


            <p><strong>Total Lifetime Payment = (Loan Payment x Number of Payments)</strong></p>

            <p>In the above example, that would be $188.60 x 60 months, or $11,322.60.</p>
            <p>Some loan types, such as mortgages, have term lengths that are shorter than the loan’s amortization
                period. You can use a mortgage interest calculator to find the total interest paid in one mortgage term.
