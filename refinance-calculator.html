            <h3>About Mortgage Refinance Calculator</h3>

            <p>A mortgage refinance is the process of replacing your current mortgage with a new one, usually with more
                favorable terms. This can include a lower interest rate, a shorter or longer loan term, or changing from
                an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage. By refinancing, you can potentially lower your
                monthly payments, reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of your loan, or access the equity
                in your home.</p>


            <p><strong>Property value:</strong> This is the total cost of the property you are purchasing. It includes
                the
                purchase price of the home itself and may include any additional costs such as closing fees or taxes.
                The loan amount is calculated based on the property value minus the down payment you can afford.</p>

            <p> <strong>Current Mortgage:</strong> A Mortgage Loan for which the last scheduled payment of debt service
                is not more than 30 days past due (without regard to any grace period) on and as of the Determination
                Date. </p>

                <strong>What are the benefits of refinancing my mortgage?</strong>
                <p>
                    There are several potential benefits to refinancing your mortgage, including:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Lowering your interest rate:</strong> If interest rates have decreased since you
                        obtained
                        your original
                        mortgage, refinancing can help you secure a lower rate and save money on interest over the life
                        of
                        your loan.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Reducing your monthly payments:</strong> If you’re struggling to make your monthly
                        mortgage payments,
                        refinancing can help you reduce your monthly payments by extending your loan term or lowering
                        your
                        interest rate.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Consolidating debt:</strong> Refinancing can be a way to consolidate high-interest
                        debt,
                        such as credit card
                        debt, into a lower interest mortgage payment.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Accessing equity in your home:</strong> If you’ve built up equity in your home,
                        refinancing can allow you to
                        access that equity and use the funds for home improvements, college tuition, or other expenses.

                <strong>How does the Freedom Capital mortgage refinance calculator work?</strong>

                <p>Our mortgage refinance calculator is a simple tool that allows you to input information about your
                    current mortgage, your new mortgage, and any closing costs or fees associated with refinancing.
                    Based on
                    this information, the calculator will generate an estimate of your monthly payments, how much you
                    could
                    save in interest, and the total cost of refinancing.</p>

                <p>To use the calculator, you’ll need to know:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The current balance on your mortgage</li>
                    <li>The current interest rate on your mortgage</li>
                    <li>The number of years remaining on your mortgage</li>
                    <li>The new interest rate you’re considering</li>
                    <li>The term of the new mortgage you’re considering</li>
                    <li>The estimated closing costs and fees associated with refinancing</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Once you’ve entered this information, the calculator will generate an estimate of your monthly
                    payments,
                    the total amount of interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan, and the total cost of
                    refinancing.
                    This information can help you determine if refinancing is the right choice for you.</p>

            <h3>Factors To Consider Before Refinancing A Mortgage</h3>

            <p>While refinancing can be a great way to save money or access equity in your home, it’s important to
                carefully consider your options before making a decision. Here are some factors to consider:</p>


            <p><strong>Your credit score:</strong> If your credit score has improved since you obtained your original
                mortgage, you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate and save money on interest over the life
                of your loan.</p>

            <p> <strong>The length of your remaining mortgage term:</strong> If you’re close to paying off your
                mortgage, refinancing may not be worth the cost, as you’ll be extending the length of your loan and
                paying more in interest over time. </p>
            <p> <strong>The fees associated with refinancing:</strong> While refinancing can save you money in the long
                run, it’s important to consider the upfront costs associated with refinancing, such as closing costs,
                appraisal fees, and other fees. Make sure you understand the total cost of refinancing and weigh it
                against the potential savings before making a decision.</p>

            <p> <strong>Your current financial situation: </strong> Refinancing can be a good option if you’re
                struggling to make your monthly mortgage payments or if you have high-interest debt that you want to
                consolidate. However, if you’re planning to move in the near future or if your income is uncertain,
                refinancing may not be the best choice for you.</p>
            <p> It’s important to carefully evaluate your options and consider your individual circumstances before
                deciding whether to refinance your mortgage.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="LoanFormulaSection">
            <div class="sectionBorder"></div>

            <h3>Refinance Calculation Formula</h3>

            <p>To calculate your loan payments, you can use a simple loan payment formula that takes into account the
                loan's principal (the amount you borrowed), the loan’s term length, and the interest rate.</p>


            <div class="flex-box-center loanFormulaBox">

                <div class="flex-box-center LoanFormulaSubBox">
                    <span><strong>Loan Payment = </strong></span>
                    <div class="flex-box-center exactFormulaBox">
                        <span class="uponLineMakeByBorder">
                            <strong>(Loan Amount) (r) (1+r)<sup>n</sup></strong>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            <strong>(1+r)<sup>n</sup> - 1</strong>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <span>where</span>

                <div class="flex-box-center defineRN">
                    <span><strong>r</strong> = Periodic Interest Rate</span>
                    <span><strong>n</strong> = Number of Payments</span>
                </div>

            </div>



            <p> To find the periodic interest rate, you will need to know your payment frequency. This is how often
                you’ll be making loan payments. For example, if you will be making monthly loan payments, then your
                payment frequency is 12 (the number of months in a year). To find the periodic interest rate, divide the
                annual interest rate by the number of payments you’ll make in one year. You’ll then convert the rate
                into decimal form.</p>
        </div>




        <div class="LoanFormulaSection">
            <div class="sectionBorder"></div>

            <h3>How To Calculate Loan Interest</h3>

            <p>To calculate the total interest paid on a loan, you will need to know your loan payment amount. Once you
                know how much your loan payment amount would be, to calculate the total interest paid on this loan, you
                would use the following formula.</p>

            <p><strong>Total Interest Paid = (Loan Payment x Number of Payments) – Loan Amount</strong></p>

            <p>For example, let’s say that you borrowed $10,000 for 5 years at a 5% interest rate. From our earlier
                example, we found the monthly payment amount would be $188.71, spread out over 60 monthly payments. How
                much interest would you pay over the life of this loan?</p>

            <p> Borrowing $10,000 at a 5% rate would cost you $1,322.60 due to interest charges over 5 years. </p>


            <div class="loanInterestFocusText">
                <p><strong>Total Interest Paid = ($188.71×60)−$10,000</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Total Interest Paid=$1,322.60</strong></p>
            </div>


            <p>This calculation uses the total lifetime payment of your loan, which is also another result that you can
                get from this page’s loan calculator. The total lifetime payment can be found by this formula:</p>


            <p><strong>Total Lifetime Payment = (Loan Payment x Number of Payments)</strong></p>

            <p>In the above example, that would be $188.60 x 60 months, or $11,322.60.</p>
            <p>Some loan types, such as mortgages, have term lengths that are shorter than the loan’s amortization
                period. You can use a mortgage interest calculator to find the total interest paid in one mortgage term.
